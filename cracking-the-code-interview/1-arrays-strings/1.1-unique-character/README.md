# Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?

## Analysis

What's the size of the character set?
`ASCII`(256)? `Unicode`(65535)? the 26 alphabeta characters? or larger character set?

For simplicity, assme the char set is `ASCII`(if not, we need to increase the storage size).
