# Trees and Graphs

Trees and graphs are common data structures, so both are fair game in a programming interview.

Tree problems are more common, howerver, because they are simple enough to implement within the time constraints of an interview and enable an interviewer to test your understanding of recursion and runtime analysis.
Graph probelms are interesting but often more complicated.

## Trees

A tree is moade up of nodes(data elements) with zero, one, or several reference(or pointers) to other nodes.
